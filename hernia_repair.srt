1
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,600
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,059
My name is Dr. Shirin Towfigh

3
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,489
from the Beverly Hills Hernia Center.

4
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,800
We are going to watch a cute little

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,520
umbilical hernia repair
performed on a lovely lady.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,009
She has a slight outie and it bothers her,

7
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,250
and everyone deserves to
have an innie umbilicus.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,770
So let's watch the specifics on how to do

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,070
a very carefully performed
umbilical hernia.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,990
And I'll walk you through the steps

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,020
of why I'm doing every little technique,

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,789
so that you can also recreate

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,009
the perfect umbilical hernia repair.

14
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,740
So first, you want
to make sure you have

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,570
the perfect incision,

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,740
and I like to hide my
incisions in a skin wrinkle.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,348
Everyone's belly button's
a little bit different,

18
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,819
so it depends on what the
belly button looks like.

19
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,319
Once you make that scar, you
identify the herniated fat

20
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,900
and you basically take it out.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,269
Sometimes you can push it back in.

22
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,150
If your hernia defect
is a centimeter or less,

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,540
you can do a nice, tissue-based repair.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,269
And I go through all the
different techniques for you

25
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,030
during the discussion of the actual video.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,019
But basically, you want to
do a tension-free repair,

27
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,810
small little bites, and pick your suture

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,810
to correlate with the strength
of the tissue of the patient.

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,599
You don't want a big suture
or really tough sutures

30
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,400
'cause that's just going to tear through.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,340
And once you're done with
closing the hernia defect,

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,200
and I usually like to close them

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,109
in a horizontal or transverse plane,

34
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,019
then it's nice to give them a nice innie.

35
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,840
Their final closure
should be very cosmetic

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,933
and they should have a nice
innie when they're done.

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,612
It's a belly button hernia.

38
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:04,829
You want it to end up as
an innie belly button.

39
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,209
Right now, she's got some fat in it

40
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,242
and she's got a cute little wrinkle here.

41
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,099
So we're gonna use this wrinkle.

42
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,349
She has two wrinkles.
Let's use this wrinkle.

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,453
That way, when you go innie,
she won't see the scar at all.

44
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:24,872
Local, please.

45
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,580
So I mark it because once
you put the local aesthetic,

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,842
it'll change the anatomy.

47
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,832
She's very thin, not so
deep. You're gonna hit bowel.

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,509
Nice, infiltrate.

49
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:46,473
Good. We're good.

50
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,953
Five CCs, at least.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,612
Some Ray-Tec's please.

52
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,522
Scalpel.

53
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,516
Another raytec, please.

54
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:13,098
Adson's, next.

55
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,060
Yes, and then notice that
we use a protected tip,

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,400
sharp needle point Bovie.

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,419
I'll take a mosquito.

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,223
Because we need it for
this delicate procedure.

59
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,362
Small operation, small scar.

60
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,620
Open that a little bit more.

61
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,532
Good.

62
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,052
Okay, so here's her hernia.

63
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,665
You can see how it's just fat.

64
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:03,990
Senn, please.

65
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,210
First, we'll take it off the skin.

66
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,949
The Senn will retract the skin without

67
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:08,909
causing any damage.

68
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,060
You have sharp Senns?

69
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,286
Oh, this is a very -

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,973
okay, so buzz that off.

71
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,910
What you can see is

72
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,230
usually it has a narrow neck.

73
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,863
There's a fascial neck, right there.

74
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:39,764
I'm just gonna take the fat off of it.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,202
It keeps coming.

76
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,129
There we go.

77
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:06,692
So now, she's flat here.

78
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:14,399
It's very familiar to
have so much fat coming out.

79
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,899
Can you tell that there's a hole in there?

80
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,413
I think you can see it
through the camera.

81
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,209
Let's clean the camera a little bit.

82
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:31,740
Okay.

83
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,783
All right, so this fat will be discarded.

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,129
Gimme a wet lap, please.

85
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,899
If you wet the skin

86
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,279
and you use cautery near it,

87
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,853
you're less likely to burn the skin.

88
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,389
Okay, so let's discard this fat.

89
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:06,209
It's clearly not a tumor.

90
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:09,062
It's, we don't need to send it to pathology.

91
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:11,913
It'll be discarded.

92
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,540
All right, so now we gotta find her hole.

93
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,689
That's actually bowel
in there, if you see.

94
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:31,733
And here's her fascial
defect, right there.

95
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,103
One edge - another mosquito, please.

96
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,252
Gotta find the other defect.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,952
Is that it?

98
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,980
This?

99
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,399
That's it, mhm.

100
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,290
That's the other defect.

101
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,139
So we're gonna be closing
it transversely like this.

102
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,802
Small bites, interrupted
with permanent suture.

103
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,759
You can see that the hole
is actually fairly big.

104
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,903
3-0, Vicryl please. I
mean, sorry, Ethibond.

105
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,850
Okay, so you see how
this is the fascia there?

106
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,182
Yes.

107
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:25,319
Is it buried knots?
Buried knots.

108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,163
Fascia there.

109
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,649
Let's go ahead. And using a
3-0 permanent suture,

110
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,699
I prefer the braided suture

111
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,642
because that's going to be felt less.

112
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,543
Smaller bite.

113
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,060
The braided suture will be felt less

114
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,273
in the thinner patients.

115
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,713
There we go.

116
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,120
So we'll tie these after we're done.

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,110
We'll get two out of each.

118
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,065
So we need another set of sutures.

119
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,699
Another set?

120
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,559
Mhm.

121
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,761
Snap, please.

122
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,523
Scissors, snap.

123
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,332
Can I get one more?

124
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,423
So we'll get three,

125
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:37,110
maybe four bites out of this.

126
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,942
Probably three.

127
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,929
The goal is to close the defect.

128
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,302
She likes to play sports.

129
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,873
Good.

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,139
This does not need to be a tight closure.

131
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,013
Scissors.

132
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,773
It's like pediatric surgery.

133
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,113
Let's do one more.

134
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,919
Let's see. Let's double check.

135
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,529
Yeah, let's do one more.

136
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,773
Way out there. You see it?

137
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,273
Better bite.

138
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,023
Good.

139
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,763
So this is about a one-centimeter defect.

140
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,149
Maybe 1.1 centimeters.

141
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:23,644
In fact, gimme a ruler if you have one.

142
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:24,332
Okay.

143
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,633
Yeah. It's
exactly one centimeter.

144
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,789
All right, go ahead and tie
the first, the last knot.

145
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,039
These are not super tight.

146
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,472
Tighter it is, the more
pain, the more ischemia.

147
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,863
Can you cut for yourself?

148
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,023
Scissors, please.

149
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,773
Four, three is enough, or four.

150
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:20,399
Key is small bites, interrupteds, work really well

151
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,993
with these smaller hernias.

152
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,529
Permanent suture.

153
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,059
You don't want the suture

154
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,993
stronger than her own tissues.

155
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,720
And then, now we're gonna close the skin.

156
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,370
Before we do that, double
check that it looks pretty.

157
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,549
And then you'll want to confirm

158
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:41,039
she has a nice innie belly button.

159
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,517
So we're gonna take that 3-0.

160
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:45,120
See that right there?

161
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,899
I'm gonna grab that right there.

162
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,529
And sew that down to the fascia level.

163
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,263
Just be on the fascia there.

164
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,130
Mhm.

165
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,133
It's absorbable suture.

166
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,633
Give her more of an innie look.

167
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,783
Okay, let's do a no-knot.

168
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:27,273
4-0 Monocryl, please.

169
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,517
Vicryl back.

170
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,179
So that's gonna go nicely,

171
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,653
and she won't see her scar.

172
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,870
Start out here.

173
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,379
So the no-knot technique helps

174
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:47,580
secure the suture without using a knot.

175
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,133
She's so - her skin is so thin,

176
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,779
she may not do well with a knot.

177
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,212
Cosmetically, she'll do
better without the knot.

178
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,202
Just a subcuticular suture.

179
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:19,066
Professionally done by a
world-renowned plastic surgeon.

180
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,506
Let's see. Lemme get this.

181
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,879
She's got really good skin.

182
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,639
Good skin?

183
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:50,009
So she has a second hernia. It's up here.

184
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,889
It's actually the one
that bothers her the most.

185
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:57,360
That's the incarcerated
epigastric hernia with fat.

186
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,990
So, she had the option of having

187
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,509
two separate small scars

188
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,360
or a slightly larger
scar at the belly button

189
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,623
and using that to access
the epigastric region.

190
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,822
And she chose the two smaller scars.

191
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,690
So take that all the way through.

192
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,590
We're gonna reuse it for the next one.

193
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,870
All right, we'll dress
those all at the end,

194
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,580
but we're kind of done with this one.

195
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,893
We're gonna move to the next hernia.

196
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,633
Steri-Strip.

197
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,710
All right, it's two by two gauze, please.

198
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,789
Let's do one that's
inside the belly button

199
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:01,322
to promote an innie.

200
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:04,682
Open it all up.

201
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,562
I stick it in there.

202
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,592
Then a second one on top.

203
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,802
Another two by two.

204
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,102
More local, please.

205
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:29,639
Let's see if we can sneak some

206
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,940
local anesthetic in there.

207
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:41,133
Yeah, I can feel the fascia

208
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,802
with the needle.

209
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,250
So umbilical hernias are very common.

210
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,379
Not everyone needs to have them repaired.

211
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,200
Watchful waiting is considered safe.

212
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,309
If you have a patient

213
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,889
who either has symptoms
from their umbilical hernia

214
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,460
or cosmetically doesn't like an outie,

215
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,590
then you can offer them surgery.

216
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,870
The surgery is often
based on the risk factors

217
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,740
for the patient and also
the quality of the hernia.

218
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,220
Most hernias less than one
centimeter can be repaired

219
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,649
without mesh and with suture only.

220
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,139
I prefer to use permanent suture.

221
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,149
There's multiple surgical techniques as

222
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,120
to how to put the hernia
back together again.

223
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,799
But typically, it's an open repair

224
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,799
or a laparoscopic repair,
with or without mesh.

225
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,610
And here, you have seen an
open repair without mesh

226
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,769
for a one-centimeter hernia.

227
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,690
You also need to take into consideration

228
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,039
the risk factors of the patient.

229
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,320
Are they obese? Do they cigarette smoke?

230
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,450
Do they use nicotine at all, actually?

231
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,879
Do they have a chronic
cough? Are they constipated?

232
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,350
Do they plan to have a pregnancy?

233
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,940
All of these are risk factors
for the hernia falling apart.

234
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,980
And so, either you
should delay the surgery

235
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,319
until those risk factors are addressed,

236
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,369
or revise the hernia repair
to address these factors

237
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,349
so you don't have a recurrence

238
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,720
because it's not just a hernia.
